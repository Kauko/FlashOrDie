FlashOrDie
==========

Unifinished game for the Global Gamejam 2013      
The player moves in a dark maze, assisted with a pulsing flashlight. A monster is stalking the player, and the closer
the monster is, the faster the flashlight will pulse. Thus the best way to avoid pitfalls is staying close to the monster...    

This game was never finished because we ran into problems with getting the flashlight to work properly.
